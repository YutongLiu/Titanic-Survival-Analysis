# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
------------------------------------------------------
This is the first time I do a data analysis project by myself after training, actually I finished it a month ago :) and now I want to record it on Github. Any comment is welcome!

Here is the [link]('https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic') of this competition on kaggle.
Brief of this competition.

+ Goal: What result do we expect?
   The Goal of this project is to predict the survival of Titanic passengers. 
+ Dataset: What data we can use to do analysis, build a model and finally reach our goal?
   There are two datasets we can use: train set and test set
+ Approach: How do we achieve our target?
   There are several steps:  
 * Defining the question
 * Inputting the dataset
 * Cleaning the data set
 * Feature Engineering
     Missing value imputation
     Exploratory Analysis
 * Prediction & Evaluation
 * Conclusion
 
 * Adjusting Parameters
 * Making our results better!
