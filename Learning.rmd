There are some key findings and learing I learnt during project, I need to note them down here otherwise I'll forget them :)

## About Using R markdown  
### 1 How to hide warning messages(e.g. those when loading packages)?
Set display option, set "message = FALSE"(default is TRUE), __NOT__ "warning = FALSE"!!!
   
### 2 How to use inline code?
It's **`** **NOT** **'** !!!  
     For example `r 4+2`, NOT 'r 4+2'
   
### 3 About creating a table in a report
The length of **-** should not be less than the longest text! Otherwise the display isn't good.
